- Selling a full radio may be impractical due to FCC reculations for testing and certification. We may have to sell a "Kit" that just requires assembling the enclosure
- How do we want do deal with the battery? Baofeng battery?
- Enclosure:
	- Small batch resin casting?
- Electrical
	- Components:
		- RF IC:
			- AK2401A:
				- Works, Made in Japan. 6dBm max output power
			- RDA1846
				- FM, used in Baofengs. Hard to source. Made in China
			- Si4468:
				- +20dBm output, new, FM support might be lacking, I would like to verify FM audio output before we decide on this IC 
		- RF Amp (we want at least 36dBm, Si4468 supports +20dbM):
			- ?
			- I might need to design my own "gain block amplifier" using transistors
		- MCU:
			- ATSAMD51J19A is on the Adafruit Feather M4
			- STM32F405 is on the TYT M380 and thus has OpenRTX built for it. This is also faster than the ATSAMD51J19A, although is has less SRAM
			- STM32F415 is a revision on the 405. I recommend this
		- Display:
			- https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/orient-display/AES200202A00-1-54ENRS/15198467
		- Display Driver:
			- SSD1681
		- GPS:
			- ZOE-M10Q-0. This is on the RAK devices. It's pretty expensive though
			- Off the shelf RAK WisBlock reciever, and make it optional?
		- SPI flash (storing DMR contacts and codeplug)
			- W27Q256JV (16MB, enough for 500,000 DMR contacts + 777,216 bytes left over for the codeplug + messages)
				- I'll add footprints for a second IC (with an inverted chip select) just in case we need the extra storage
