- Selling a full radio may be impractical due to FCC reculations for testing and certification. We may have to sell a "Kit" that just requires assembling the enclosure
- How do we want do deal with the battery? Baofeng battery?
- Enclosure:
	- Small batch resin casting?
- Electrical
	- Components:
		- RF IC:
			- AK2401A:
				- Works, Made in Japan. 6dBm max output power
			- RDA1846
				- FM, used in Baofengs. Hard to source. Made in China
			- Si4468:
				- +20dBm output, new, FM support might be lacking. This seems like the best choice
		- RF Amp (we want at least 36dBm, Si4468 supports +20dbM):
			- MAAM-011229-TR1000
			- AFT09MS007N
			- I might need to design my own "gain block amplifier" using transistors
		- RF Switch:
			- for switching the amplifier in/out for low power output (wideband tx) and recieving
		- MCU:
			- ATSAMD51J19A is on the Adafruit Feather M4
			- STM32F405 is on the TYT M380 and thus has OpenRTX built for it. This is also faster than the ATSAMD51J19A, although is has less SRAM
			- STM32F415 is a revision on the 405
			- RP2354A/B or RP2350A/B. This is the best option. Optional external flash, more ram, dual core, faster clock. 		
				- There are a couple of hardware bugs; Don't use the internal pulldown resistors and external pulldowns need to be 	less than 8k2 ohm. Power circuitry seems to be very semsitive to EMI (Use external regulator?)
				- Single ADC (with multiple pin inputs) that is capable of running on it's own to fill a buffer (8 samples @ 12bit. 96 bits). We might want to use I2S as a microphone
		- Display:
			- https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/orient-display/AES200202A00-1-54ENRS/15198467
		- Display Driver:
			- SSD1681 Not necessary, The display i chose is SPI
		- GPS:
			- ZOE-M10Q-0. This is on the RAK devices. It's pretty expensive though
			- Off the shelf RAK WisBlock reciever, and make it optional?
		- SPI flash (storing DMR contacts and codeplug)
			- W25Q256JV (16MB, enough for 500,000 DMR contacts + 777,216 bytes left over for the codeplug + messages)
				- I may add footprints for a second IC (with an inverted chip select) just in case we need the extra storage
			- BY25Q256FS
		- SD slot
			- MEM2061
			- instead of the flash for APRS storage and contacts, let's use an SD card and keep the codeplug maybe on the primary MCU flash?. The connector is ~$1, and it also uses SPI
		- Battery charging IC
			- MCP73844. needs an external PMOS
				- LM51571 to boost the 5V up to charge voltage 
		- BMS, only needed if designing battery
			- BQ2947? does this balance, or just monitor?
			- S-8252AAY-M6T1U 
		- Microphone
			- SPH0645LM4H-B, I2S MEMS mic. Needs PIO
			- Analog mic and compander into built in ADC?
		- Speaker amp
			- I2S amp
			- TAS2110? Maybe too smart for our needs
			- MAX98357A. Seems like the best option, supports I2S (and PDM, but I2S seems to have the least overhead). Needs PIO for I2S
		- Speaker
			- AS01808AO-WP-R
