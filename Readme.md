# OSS-Radio

HT-15. What will set this radio apart from competitors is:
Fully open source, hardware and software
Swappable radio module, allowing easy hardware upgradability (2M/70CM at launch)
USBC charge and data, SD card, Kenwood style audio connector, removable battery
Low-power E-ink display targeting 72+ hour standby time
FM and M17 support at launch, with plans to support many other digital modes in the future such as DMR, P25 (depending on codec licensing)
Ability for community to write and easily install “apps” that allow custom features or arbitrary digital mode development
Usable “off the shelf”. We will be selling the radio as a complete unit (not just a devboard)
Target price between $200 and $300, Selling all individual parts on our website for repairability

At it's current state, the hardware is untested. That will change soon. We have prototypes on the way
